      <b>Good Practice for the use of E-Mail</b>

        Introduction
        <br />

    </p>
    <p>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of e-mail has gained popularity within individuals and among
      HAHO, hospitals and institutions. Internet e-mail is also commonly used for communication
      between the HA and outside organizations. E-mail enables us to reduce the workload of internal
      dispatch, to distribute messages more easily to colleagues for action and to add value more
      effectively to other colleagues&apos; input. Officers are encouraged to use this efficient
      means of communication as far as possible.
    </p>
    <p>Appropriate Use</p>
    <p>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HA e-mail systems are provided to officers as part of the HA
      resources to enhance their communication with other officers or external parties, and to
      discharge their official duties more efficiently. Hence, extensive use of the e-mail systems
      for private communication or activities should be avoided.
    </p>

        E-mail as written communication
        <br />
      </u>
    </p>
    <p>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that e-mails are dealt
      with expeditiously having regard to its high speed in transmission and the expectation of the
      sender for a quick response.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users could represent himself/herself, the respective
      department/hospital, or the HA when communicating with others. Care and discretion should be
      exercised in the same manner as in written correspondence on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials considered inappropriate, offensive or disrespectful to
      others should not be disseminated.
    </p>
    <p>Copyright Materials and Classified Documents</p>
    <p>
      6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users should not disseminate copyright material, including those
      downloaded from the Internet, without the prior permission of the copyright owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classified messages/data/documents in all forms should bear the same
      classification as for the paper equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidential messages/data/documents should not be transmitted via
      e-mail as far as possible.
    </p>
    <p>Security</p>
    <p>
      9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attachments received through e-mails especially from an unknown
      party should be scanned for viruses before opening, using up-to-date virus detection software,
      and reported to the E-mail administrator if there is any suspicion of carrying such threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer should not be left unattended if it has been logged on
      to the e-mail system. It must be logged off or with access inhibited, say by screen activation
      password, every time it is left unattended.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users are responsible for the safekeeping of their e-mail accounts
      and for all activities performed using their accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users should use passwords with a mix of alphabetic and
      non-alphabetic characters (digits or punctuation) and change their passwords periodically. It
      is advisable to use passwords that are difficult to guess but easy to remember, so that users
      do not have to write them down.

        E-mail Traffic Control and Delivery
        <br />
      </u>
    </p>
    <p>
      13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chain e-mails (i.e. e-mails requesting the recipients to pass the
      e-mails on to others) should be ignored or destroyed because they can degrade network
      performance and consume substantial disk space to the extent of making the e-mail system
      malfunction. Substantial damage could result if the chain e-mail carries an attachment that is
      infected by virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is required to send unsolicited e-mails to a large group of
      recipients for optional information distribution or sharing, instead of sending them to all
      users in a department, a separate list with target audience should be used. The size of the
      unsolicited e-mail should not exceed 1MB.
    </p>
    <p>
      15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to ensure that an accurate address and an intended
      recipient have been specified when issuing an e-mail, especially when an external party is
      involved. It is embarrassing or even damaging to have sent an e-mail to a wrong party.
    </p>
    <p>
      16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is advisable to select the recipients from the e-mail system
      address book, if applicable. Personal address books, if used, should be updated regularly.
      E-mail addresses copied from old e-mails are prone to errors or unsuccessful delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users should consult the E-mail administrator when having
      difficulties in distinguishing between a real virus alert or a virus hoax (an untrue
      virus-related warning/ alert started by malicious individuals). HAHO keeps E-mail
      administrators updated by virus alerts through e-mails. Users can also refer to the HA
      Intranet web page on information related to of anti-virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not advisable to request for return receipts unless
      confirmation is absolutely necessary, say for sending materials classified as restricted.
      &apos;Return receipt&apos; will create a lot of traffic in the network especially if the mail
      is addressed to a large number of recipients.
    </p>
    <p>
      19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great care must be exercised when sending large attachments in an
      e-mail because this may slow down the network traffic. Users may use authorised file
      compression software to compress the attachments before sending them out with e-mails.
      Alternatively, users send the pointer to the document instead of attaching it to the e-mail.
      The restriction currently applies to each e-mail is 4Mb.
    </p>
    <p>
      20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove any unnecessary attachments and e-mail histories in replying
      to e-mails in order to reduce network traffic and save storage space on the e-mail systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activate auto-answering function, where available, when your email
      account will not be checked for a period of time (due to reasons such as annual leave).

        Regular housekeeping
        <br />
      </u>
    </p>
    <p>
      22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The e-mail system must not be used as a storage area for files and
      documents because old e-mails will be purged periodically. Users should do regular
      housekeeping on their e-mail accounts with a view to keeping their mailbox to a manageable
      size. This means archiving those e-mails and attachments which have to be retained, and
      deleting old and obsolete ones.
    </p>
    <p>Environmental protection</p>
    <p>
      23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print out e-mails only when necessary or required for record
      keeping purposes.
